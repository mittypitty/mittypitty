Aspiring Game Developer | Unity Enthusiast | Java & Python Programmer

I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Shahid Beheshti University, where my passion for programming and technology has flourished. With a solid foundation in Java, I have expanded my expertise to game development, actively working with Unity to bring creative concepts to life.

My journey in the world of code doesn't stop there. I'm delving into Python and Django, eager to master web development and broaden my skill set. This diverse range of experiences reflects my deep love for programming, and I am committed to continuous learning and innovation.

Whether it's building immersive game environments or crafting efficient, scalable web applications, I am driven by the challenge of turning complex ideas into functional, engaging experiences. I'm excited to contribute to and learn from the vibrant developer community on GitHub and beyond.

Let's create something amazing together!
